# Space Invaders Redux

This is a remake of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. It was made using Python and Pygame.

## 🚀 Introduction
The player controls a spaceship that can move horizontally and shoot projectiles. 

## 🏁 The Objective
The objective is to destroy all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.
The aliens can also shoot bullets and the player loses if the spaceship is hit by an alien bullet or if an alien reaches the bottom of the screen.

## 💯 Scoring System
The player earns points by destroying alien invaders.  
`+100 points` — Invader destroyed  
`-10 points` — Cost of an ammo round  
`+1000 points` — bonus for each second left on the timer
